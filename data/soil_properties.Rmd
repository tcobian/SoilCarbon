```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Make a sample data set of soil properties
```{r}
bulk_density = rnorm(mean = 0.71, sd = 0.3, n = 100)

percent_soc = rnorm(mean = 0.02, sd = 0.0001, n = 100)

percent_clay = rnorm(mean = 0.05, sd = 0.01, n = 100)

soil_properties = cbind(bulk_density, percent_soc, percent_clay)
```

run this data into the package
```{r}
use_data(soil_properties, pkg = SoilCarbon)
```
